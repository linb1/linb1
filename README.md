### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brian Lin and I am a software engineer with experience building complex web applications using JavaScript, React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, Mongoose, MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, SQL, and ActionCable.

I recently graduated from App Academyâ€™s software engineering program, and am looking forward to advancing my career as a software engineer. I always had a passion for learning and creating new things, so Iâ€™m happy that I am able to do that with software development. Currently, my main project is A Thousand Miles, a MERN stack road trip planning app (using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) that allows a user to draw their route on a map and store interesting attractions along the route in their own itineraries. On the side, I am constantly looking to add more languages and technologies to my arsenal.

When I am not coding, I love learning new skills and finding new hobbies. Right now, I am trying to learn to cook so eventually I can make food just as good as my mom does. Also, I am a huge fan of games and sport, especially when I can play with others! Iâ€™m always looking to improve and challenge myself, so feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-lin-1590/) or email me at [linbrian.b@gmail.com](mailto:linbrian.b@gmail.com)
